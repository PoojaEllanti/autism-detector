# 🧠 AI-Powered Early Autism Detector

This project detects early signs of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in toddlers using video analysis and AI. It focuses on non-invasive, multimodal visual cues including:

- 👁️ Eye Contact Detection
- 🔁 Repetitive Behavior Detection
- ✋ Gesture/Language Delay Proxy
- 🤝 Social Reciprocity Assessment

## 🚀 How it Works
1. Upload a toddler's interaction video (MP4 format).
2. The system analyzes behavior using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
3. A final risk score is displayed indicating potential signs of ASD.

## 🖥️ Streamlit App
The app allows easy upload and analysis of toddler videos. Risk is computed and displayed instantly.
